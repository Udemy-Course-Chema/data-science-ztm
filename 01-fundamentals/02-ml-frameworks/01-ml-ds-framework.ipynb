    "\n",
    "It is called supervised because **has data and labels**\n",

    "Types:\n",
    "1. Classification\n",
    "    1. \"Is this example one thing or another?\" \n",

    "    3. Multi-class classification = more than two options\n",
    "2. Regression\n",
    "    1. \"How much will this house sell for?\"\n",
    "    2. \"How many people will buy this app? Based a website visit and click.\"\n",
    "    3. Predict by numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unsurpervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Has data but no labels.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "* Purchase history of all customers at store. \n",
    "    * Then the marketing want to send out a promotion for next summer. \n",

    "#### Transfer Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "One Machine Learning model has learned in another machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "It involves having a computer program perform some actions within a defined space \n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning was used for DeepMind's AlphaGo. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "* Playing Chess"
